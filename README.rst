About
=====

This `Sublime Text 2/3`_ package provides support for working with tags
generated by `Exuberant CTags`_

.. _Sublime Text 2/3: http://sublimetext.com/
.. _Exuberant CTags: http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

The ctags command is searched for on the system PATH. It works by doing a
binary search of a memory-mapped tags file, so it will work efficiently with
very large (50MB+) tags files if needed.

See this `forum thread`_ for a bit of historical background on the Sublime Text plugin.

Installation
============

The easiest way to install this plugin, is to use the `Package Control`_ 
plugin, by `Will Bond`_

.. _Package Control: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/
.. _Will Bond: http://wbond.net/

Alternatively, the plugin can be installed manually using one of the following
methods.

Using Git
---------
Go to your Sublime Text Packages directory and clone the repository
using the command below::

  $ git clone https://github.com/SublimeText/CTags

Manual Download
---------------

* Download the files using the .zip download option
* Unzip the files (and rename the folder to CTags if needed)
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text Packages directory

Additional Setup Steps
======================

OS X
----

The default ``ctags`` executable in OSX does not support recursive directory
search (i.e. ``ctags -R``). To get a proper copy of ctags, use one of the
following options:

* Using `Homebrew`_::

    brew install ctags

* Using `MacPorts`_::

    port install ctags

.. _`Homebrew`: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
.. _`MacPorts`: http://www.macports.org/

Ensure that the ``PATH`` is updated so the correct version is run:

* If ``which ctags`` doesn't point at ctags in ``/usr/local/bin``, make sure
  you add ``/usr/local/bin`` to your ``PATH`` ahead of the folder 
  ``which ctags`` reported.
* Alternatively, add the path to the new ``ctags`` executable to the settings,
  under ``command``. If you have Xcode / Apple Developer Tools installed this
  path will likely be ``/usr/local/bin/ctags``.

Linux
-----

To install ctags use your package manager. 

* For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)::

    sudo apt-get install ctags

* For Red Hat-based systems (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS)::

    sudo yum install ctags

And so forth

Windows
-------

* Download the `CTags binary`_ from the `Exuberant CTags`_ site.
* Extract ``ctags.exe`` from the downloaded zip to 
  ``C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2`` or any folder within your PATH so that
  Sublime Text can run it.
* Alternatively, extract to any folder and add the path to this folder to
  the ``command`` setting.

.. _CTags binary: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ctags/ctags58.zip

Usage
=====

This uses tag files created by the ``ctags -R -f .tags`` command by default
(although this can be overriden in settings).

The plugin will try to find a ``.tags`` file in the same directory as the
current view, walking up directories until it finds one. If it can't find one
it will offer to build one (in the directory of the current view)

If a symbol can't be found in a tags file, it will search in additional
locations that are specified in the ``CTags.sublime-settings`` file (see 
below).

If you are a Rubyist, you can build a Ruby Gem's tags with the following
script::

  require 'bundler'
  paths = Bundler.load.specs.map(&:full_gem_path)
  system("ctags -R -f .gemtags #{paths.join(' ')}")

Settings
========

By default, Sublime will include ctags files in your project, which causes
them to show up in the file tree and search results. To disable this behaviour
you should add a ``file_exclude_patterns`` entry to your 
``Preferences.sublime-settings`` or your project file. For example::

  "file_exclude_patterns": [".tags", ".tags_sorted_by_file", ".gemtags"]

In addition to this setting, there's a ``CTags.sublime-settings`` file, which
can be edited like any other ``.sublime-settings`` file

* ``filters`` will allow you to set scope specific filters against a field of
  the tag. In the excerpt above, imports tags like ``from a import b`` are 
  filtered::

    '(?P<symbol>[^\t]+)\t'
    '(?P<filename>[^\t]+)\t'
    '(?P<ex_command>.*?);"\t'
    '(?P<type>[^\t\r\n]+)'
    '(?:\t(?P<fields>.*))?'

* ``extra_tag_paths`` is a list of extra places to look for keyed by 
* ``(selector, platform)``. Note the ``platform`` is tested against 
  ``sublime.platform()`` so any values that function returns are valid.
* ``extra_tag_files`` is a list of extra files relative to the original file
* ``command`` is the path to the version of ctags to use, for example::

    "command" : "/usr/local/bin/ctags"

  or::

    "command" : "C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\CTags\ctag.exe"

The rest of the options are fairly self explanatory.
