== CTags ==

This [[http://sublimetext.com|Sublime Text 2]] Package provides support for working with tags generated by [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/|Exuberant CTags]]

The ctags command is searched for on PATH. It works by doing a binary search of
an mmap()'d `.tags` file so it will work efficiently with very large ( 50MB+ etc
) tags files if needed.

== Exuberant Tags ==

This is only designed to work with [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/|Exuberant CTags]]

=== OS X ===

If anyone is having trouble getting the CTags -R flag to work on OSX, you are probably using the stock CTags installation.

* Follow the instructions on http://adamyoung.net/Exuberant-Ctags-OS-X to install a good version of CTags that recognizes the -R flag. This installs CTags to /usr/local/bin.

Note: There is a broken link on that page - looks like it was an old sourceforge mirror. Here's a working link:
http://ignum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ctags/ctags/5.8/ctags-5.8.tar.gz

* Make sure that Sublime Text is using the right version of CTags: Ensure that ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist has /usr/local/bin in the PATH string before /usr/bin (the standard location for CTags). Here's a sample environment.plist that should work:


{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
<key>PATH</key>
<string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
</dict>
</plist>
}}}
* If /usr/local/bin wasn't in your PATH already, you have to log out and log back in for the environment variables to be read in again.

=== Dependencies ===

* No dependencies!

=== Installation ===

If you are a git user, the best way to install the package and keep up to date
is to clone the repo directly into your /Packages directory in the Sublime Text
2 application settings area.

==== Using Git ====

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the repository using the command below:

{{{
$ git clone https://github.com/SublimeText/CTags CTags
}}}

==== Download Manually ====

* Download the files using the .zip download option
* Unzip the files (and rename the folder to CTags if needed)
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory

=== About ===

See this [[http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=144|forum thread]] for a bit of background.

=== Usage ===

This uses `.tags` files created in `ctags -R -f .tags` recursive mode.

The commands will try and find a `tags` file in the same directory as
the current view, walking up directories until it finds one. If it
can't find one it will offer to build some ( in the directory of the
current view ) (TODO: doesn't ask as missing api from S1)

If a symbol can't be found in a tags file it will search in
alternative locations.

If you create a file `tags_search_paths` in the same folder as your
`tags` file, listing alternative locations (full absolute paths, one
per line) it will search those files also.

eg 

{{{
D:\myProject\tags
}}}

=== Other Settings ===

There's a CTags.sublime-settings file:

{{{
{
    "debug"           :  false,
    "ctags_command"   :  "ctags -R -f .tags",
    "filters"         :  {
        "source.python": {"type":"^i$"}
    },
    "definition_filters": {
        "source.php": {"type":"^v$"}
    },
    "definition_current_first": false,
    "show_context_menus": false,
    "extra_tag_paths" :  [ [["source.python", "windows"], "C:\\Python27\\Lib\\tags"]],
    "extra_tag_files" : [".gemtags"]
}
}}}

`filters` will allow you to set scope specific filters against a field of the
tag. In the excerpt above, imports tags like "from a import b" are filtered.

{{{
    '(?P<symbol>[^\t]+)\t'
    '(?P<filename>[^\t]+)\t'
    '(?P<ex_command>.*?);"\t'
    '(?P<type>[^\t\r\n]+)'
    '(?:\t(?P<fields>.*))?'
}}}


`extra_tag_paths` is a list of extra places to look for keyed by (selector, platform)

`extra_tag_files` is a list of extra files relative to the original .tags file

Note the platform (`windows` in the example above) is tested against
`sublime.platform()` so any values that function returns are valid.

The rest of the options are fairly self explanatory.
