== CTags ==

This [[http://sublimetext.com|Sublime Text 2]] Package provides support for working with tags generated by [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/|Exuberant CTags]]

The ctags command is searched for on PATH. It works by doing a binary search of
an mmap()'d `.tags` file so it will work efficiently with very large ( 50MB+ etc
) tags files if needed.

=== OS X ===

If anyone is having trouble getting the CTags -R flag to work on OSX, you are probably using the stock CTags installation.

To get a proper copy of ctags, use one of the following options:
* Using [[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/|Homebrew]]:
{{{brew install ctags}}}
* Using [[http://www.macports.org/|MacPorts]]:
{{{port install ctags}}}

*Make sure that Sublime Text is using the right version of CTags:*
* If 'which ctags' doesn't point at ctags in '/usr/local/bin', make sure you add '/usr/local/bin' to your PATH ahead of the folder that 'which ctags' reported.
** Add or modify the 'export PATH=...' (e.g. in ~/.profile) to make the change permanent

=== Linux ===

To get a proper copy of ctags, use one of the following options:
* In a terminal session:
{{{sudo apt-get install ctags}}}

=== Windows ===

Download the [[http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ctags/ctags58.zip|binary ctags.exe]] from [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/|Exuberant Ctags site]].

Extract `ctags.exe` from the download zip to "C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2" or any folder that within your PATH so CTags support for Sublime Text 2 can run it.

=== Dependencies ===

* No dependencies!

=== Installation ===

If you are a git user, the best way to install the package and keep up to date
is to clone the repo directly into your /Packages directory in the Sublime Text
2 application settings area.

==== Using Git ====

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the repository using the command below:

{{{
$ git clone https://github.com/SublimeText/CTags CTags
}}}

==== Download Manually ====

* Download the files using the .zip download option
* Unzip the files (and rename the folder to CTags if needed)
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory

=== About ===

See this [[http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=144|forum thread]] for a bit of background.

=== Usage ===

This uses `.tags` files created in `ctags -R -f .tags` recursive mode.

The commands will try and find a `tags` file in the same directory as
the current view, walking up directories until it finds one. If it
can't find one it will offer to build some ( in the directory of the
current view ) (TODO: doesn't ask as missing api from S1)

If a symbol can't be found in a tags file it will search in
alternative locations.

If you create a file `tags_search_paths` in the same folder as your
`tags` file, listing alternative locations (full absolute paths, one
per line) it will search those files also.

eg

{{{
D:\myProject\tags
}}}

If you are a rubyist, you can build the whole Ruby Gems ctags file for your application seperately via a `build_gemtags.rb` script:

{{{
require 'bundler'
paths = Bundler.load.specs.map(&:full_gem_path)
system("ctags -R -f .gemtags #{paths.join(' ')}")
}}}

=== Other Settings ===

There's a CTags.sublime-settings file:

{{{
{
    "debug"           :  false,
    "ctags_command"   :  "ctags -R -f .tags",
    "filters"         :  {
        "source.python": {"type":"^i$"}
    },
    "definition_filters": {
        "source.php": {"type":"^v$"}
    },
    "definition_current_first": false,
    "show_context_menus": false,
    "extra_tag_paths" :  [ [["source.python", "windows"], "C:\\Python27\\Lib\\tags"]],
    "extra_tag_files" : [".gemtags"]
}
}}}

`filters` will allow you to set scope specific filters against a field of the
tag. In the excerpt above, imports tags like "from a import b" are filtered.

{{{
    '(?P<symbol>[^\t]+)\t'
    '(?P<filename>[^\t]+)\t'
    '(?P<ex_command>.*?);"\t'
    '(?P<type>[^\t\r\n]+)'
    '(?:\t(?P<fields>.*))?'
}}}


`extra_tag_paths` is a list of extra places to look for keyed by (selector, platform)

`extra_tag_files` is a list of extra files relative to the original .tags file

Note the platform (`windows` in the example above) is tested against
`sublime.platform()` so any values that function returns are valid.

The rest of the options are fairly self explanatory.
